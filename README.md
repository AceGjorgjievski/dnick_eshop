- Final homework of Human-Computer Interaction course


### Simple E-Shop for managing list of products, add then to a shopping cart and place orders.


**There are two types of roles: User, Admin**

The '**User**' role can only add product into the shopping cart and place an order. <br>
The '**Admin**' can only add a product into the application (database), remove it, modify it. 

This project was deployed online for free, I did that on [render.com](https://render.com), where
I created one service for the java Spring boot app and another one for PostgreSQL database.

Unfortunately, the service for the Spring boot app failed because it ran out
of memory while running the code.

This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7lel5LdVjyO7jk-4biyr0fqPVygTLOk) helped me how to host the application online.
Videos 5 & 8.

**Note**: if you have problems to go to this directory ``cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin`` 
make sure to add to your **PATH environment variable**.

Here are some photos of the application:
